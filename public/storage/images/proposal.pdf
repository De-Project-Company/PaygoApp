Dear Golden United Fc.,

I am writing to propose the development of a custom web application for your football club. With a user-friendly interface and a range of features, this web app will provide a one-stop-shop for all of your club's online needs, this can also act as a reference for your football club where a user can view information about the club.

The app will feature a news section for the latest club updates, a schedule of upcoming games and events, the app will display players and their stats for prospective scouting. Additionally, the app will include a live stream system.

The app will be fully responsive, meaning it will be optimized for viewing on all devices, including smartphones and tablets. It will also be built using the latest web technologies, ensuring that it is fast, secure, and easy to use.

Furthermore, we will provide you with a back-end dashboard where you can manage the content of the app, including news articles, events, club information and player stat update.

Our team has extensive experience in web development. We are confident that we can deliver a high-quality product that meets your club's needs.

We would be happy to provide you with a detailed proposal and schedule for the project, as well as a quote for the development costs. Please let us know if you are interested in proceeding with this project, and we will schedule a meeting to discuss the details further.

Thank you for your time, and we look forward to working with your club.

Sincerely,
[Nova Digital Technology]
